# 🌐 Personal Portfolio – Built with React & Passion
---
This is my personal portfolio website built with React and styled using CSS and some Bootstrap elements. It showcases my skills, experience, and projects as a web developer and designer, and includes a custom integration with Mailchimp to handle contact form submissions directly from the site.

## 🔧 Features

- **Dynamic Landing Section:**
The homepage features a full-screen video background (optimized for performance and lazy-loaded after 30% scroll visibility) with an animated text component that types and deletes role descriptions like “Web Developer”, “Web Designer”, and “UI/UX Designer” in a loop.

- **Sticky Responsive Navbar:**
A transparent navigation bar that changes on scroll, includes smooth transitions and quick access to internal sections like Skills, Projects, and Contact, as well as external links (LinkedIn, GitHub, Instagram).

- **Smooth Scroll & Call-to-Action Buttons:**
"Drop me a message" button on the homepage scrolls directly to the contact section at the bottom. The "Let's connect" button links to my LinkedIn profile (subject to change).

- **Skills Section with Interactive Carousel:**
Skills are shown in a horizontal scrollable carousel with animated circular progress indicators that load dynamically as each item appears on screen.

- **Projects Section with Interactive Filters:**
Displays categorized projects (Software Development, Marketing & Design, and Management). Background subtly reacts to mouse movement. Each category filters the projects accordingly. Clicking on a project uses React Router to navigate to a detail page (under construction – currently shows a placeholder alert).

- **Footer with Integrated Contact Form:**
The footer includes social links and a contact form powered by MailchimpForm. It allows users to submit their email and a message without leaving the page. A success message is displayed after successful submission.

## 📫 Contact & Deployment

- Emails submitted through the contact form are received directly in my Mailchimp inbox.

- The site is currently deployed via GitHub Pages. I plan to host it externally in the future once it’s fully finalized.

## 🎯 About this Project

This portfolio represents my passion for programming, design, and learning. Every piece of functionality — from animations to API integration — was implemented by myself, using official documentation, online resources, code exploration, feedback from peers, and help from tools like ChatGPT.

Most of the projects shown here are personal or collaborative efforts without financial gain, but full of learning. This project is part of my journey to grow as a developer and to pursue a professional career in web development.
